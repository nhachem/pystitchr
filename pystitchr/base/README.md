# (Data)Stitchr Base

## What is (Data)Stitchr Base? ###

This code base contains the basic DataFrame manipulations and tooling to extend pyspark and support [Stitchr](https://github.com/nhachem/).

Most of this tooling is to consolidate by adding transformation functions to support

    * data validation
    * dataframe transforms
    * data wrangling
    * udf functions

 This is the python version of the code under development.

to run tests make sure you set up the `ROOT_DIR`
from the top project directory by
`source bash/stitchr_env.sh`
Then run 
`./run_tests.sh`
